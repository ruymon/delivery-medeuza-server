# Delivery Medeuza Server
Laravel Server for Delivery Meduza. API and MVC Application

Keep in mind this is a proof of concept: some bodges were used to make this work. 

It can be heaviliy improved by moving the dashboard elsewhere and implementing a websocket connection to it.

Things still to improve:
 - A proper permissions system for administrators, users (to avoid flooding) and law enforcement;
 - A way for law enforcement/volunteers to be notified when new orders go in, update their status and get useful information to act;
 - A proper queue system;
 - A notification system via e-mail and SMS to allow the system to give status updates to the user;
 - A chat to communicate with the user?
